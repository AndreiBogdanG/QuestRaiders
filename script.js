descriptions.push(`You‚Äôre in a trip in Transylvania (Romania), searching for the legendary vampire named Dracula. You travel with some friends and family members. You hear about an old, abandoned castle which supposedly belonged to the Wallachian ruler Vlad III, also named ‚ÄúThe Impaler‚Äù, the one who is believed to have turned into the infamous vampire. \n \n This castle - it is said - holds a very old secret, maybe even Dracula‚Äôs resting place. In order to discover that secret, one must first find out the precise years some specific historical events took place. You approach the castle and start to inspect it from the outside‚Ä¶`);
descriptions.push(`A while ago, you found a very important artifact: the resting place of Vlad the Impaler, the Wallachian ruler who got the nickname Dracula and inspired the famous vampire character. The only problem - the coffin seems to be protected by some kind of spell (or at least that‚Äôs what it suggests). In this quest, you must find the secret spell which opens it and check if the Dark Lord is true or legend.
It‚Äôs now time to get your gang ready, return to Transylvania and solve the Impaler‚Äôs mystery once and for all. One of your Romanian contacts promised to help you. So, you get your team and catch a plane to Bucharest...`);
descriptions.push(`This is a bundle containing the 2 parts of the Vlad Dracula instant download, print-it-yourself treasure hunt:
- PART 1: The Search for a Legendary Vampire;
- PART 2: A Legendary Quest in Transylvania.
These are 2 independent games, only linked through the story. They can be played in any order, but we recommend playing Part 1 first.
These are educational, not horror games; we recommend players aged 12 and up. Smaller children can play too, but probably need some help with some of the puzzles.`);
descriptions.push(`You take your friends to an exotic vacation to the Caribbeans. On the third day, while visiting a flea market, you stumble upon an
old book which catches your attention.
‚ÄúEs muy barato!‚Äù ‚Äì says the old seller. Yes, true, it‚Äôs pretty cheap for its value, so you decide to buy it. At your hotel, while browsing
through the book, you find what seems to be an old map. Interesting!
Another day in paradise. You go to the beach, enjoy the sun and the palm trees, but still feel the need for some action. You remember the
map. What if‚Ä¶
You gather your friends and tell them you want to go on an adventure.
‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt go alone, it‚Äôs too dangerous! We‚Äôll join you, that‚Äôs what friends are for!‚Äù
So, you rent a cheap, old sailboat and follow the map. It leads you to a rather small, remote island. Your boat gets stuck in some rocks.
‚ÄúI hope the tide will help us leave! Until then, let‚Äôs explore!‚Äù
Further on the island, you discover something written on a rock:
‚ÄúOnly the worthy can leave. Solve all puzzles! Cpt. J. W.‚Äù
You understand that you must solve some puzzles before you leave, so you continue to explore. You should have enough time before the
tide.`);
descriptions.push(`While visiting Egypt with a group of friends and relatives, you accidentally open a secret door inside the Big Pyramid of Giza. Full of curiosity, you all enter and the door closes behind you. OH, NO, YOU ARE TRAPPED! No problem, though, your brilliant minds will make an effort and find a way out. Calmly, you take out your flashlights and start exploring‚Ä¶
You realize that the room has another door, somehow protected by magic. You will need a special word to open it, so you look around, gather clues and try to solve the puzzle. This word could be anything! After you find the word, you must check it on the answers page. This must be accomplished by the Game Master or Game Wizard. Only if it‚Äôs correct can you go to the next chamber.
Every puzzle will open a door, every opened door will take you to the next chamber. How many chambers are there? When will you get out? Well‚Ä¶ this depends on you. Cooperate as good as you can with your team and it will all be a fun adventure.
Ready? Let‚Äôs start!`);
